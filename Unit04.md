**Unit 4: Market Research** <span id="4"></span> 
*Market analysis is one of the most vital components of any type of
business plan. Without verifiable information about the market to
support your recommendations, the remaining components of your plan
(objectives, strategy, and execution) are simply guesswork and will be
of little value to an executive decision maker. In this unit, we will
examine types of research data and the processes involved in collecting
marketing data.*
