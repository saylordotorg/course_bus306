**Unit 3: Communication and Decision Making** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about the dynamic communication process
between advertisers and consumers. We will examine both traditional
and nontraditional models of communication to see how today’s consumers
are more active in marketing communication. Giving consumers a degree of
control over the advertising message creates a much higher degree of
target market selectivity, but it also creates a more complex, two-sided
communications model for marketers.  
  
 In addition, you will learn how cultural influences and consumer
involvement affect buying behavior. Have you ever been shopping with
someone who just cannot make a decision? How about a shopper who
immediately finds what she wants and makes a quick purchasing decision?
A successful advertiser must know how to move consumers from one stage
of the decision-making process to the next, i.e., need recognition,
information search, evaluation of alternatives, purchase, and finally,
post–purchase evaluation. *
