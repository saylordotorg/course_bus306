**Unit 9: Media Planning** <span id="9"></span> 
*After the advertiser has formulated its advertising objectives and
settled on the appropriate strategy, it must select the most effective
media vehicles and implement them through the media plan. A high degree
of innovation characterizes today’s advertising industry. Traditional
media are changing as an abundance of new placement opportunities
appear. It seems that no “white space” is safe from advertising. Product
placement in films, coupons on the back of your airline boarding pass,
wildly entertaining outdoor ads, etc., compete for every spare moment
and all blank space.  
  
 In this unit, we will consider the optimal timing and placement of the
advertising message with a focus on choosing the right types of media
for a given campaign. You will also see how non-traditional web, mobile,
and social media are growing into what may well be the most dynamic
advertising media in the industry.*
