**Unit 8: An Integrated Marketing Communication Approach** <span
id="8"></span> 
*Successful businesses have found that coordinating their marketing
communication efforts across all channels helps them focus a more
effective and unified message to their market. In this course, the term
“marketing communication” is synonymous with the fourth “P” in the
marketing mix: “Promotion.”  
  
 By way of illustration, think of one of the top two soft drink brands
in the U.S. When you go to a professional sporting event, you are likely
to experience that company’s message through billboards, contests,
public relations, sponsorships, a coupon on the back of the event
ticket, free samples, and the list goes on. All of these promotional
activities will contain a consistent message because these companies are
experienced at building brand equity and they know what works:
integrated marketing communication, or IMC.  
  
 In this unit, you will learn how integrated marketing communication
helps companies build brand equity. We will examine the elements of the
promotional mix to see how each serves as a unique customer contact
point in an IMC promotional plan.*
