**Unit 7: Advertising Strategy** <span id="7"></span> 
*Advertising strategy is the link between the firm’s present situation
and where their advertising objectives project they want to be in the
future. Once the advertising agency draws a clear picture of the
marketing environment and works with the advertiser to establish
measurable objectives, it must formulate a strategy for reaching the
client’s goals.  
    
 Advertisers will rely heavily on the experts at the advertising agency
for strategy formulation. The text presents a number of video interviews
with the staff at SS+K to give us insight into the talent that they
bring to this task. In this unit, you will learn about branding
strategies and the formulation of clear and measurable advertising
objectives.*
