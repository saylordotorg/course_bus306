**Unit 6: The Advertising Budget** <span id="6"></span> 
*In Chapter 3 of* Flash!*, the authors noted that advertising revenue in
the US alone accounts for 2.5 percent of the nation’s Gross National
Product. This represents a line on the firm’s income statement that
decision makers will scrutinize closely. Creating the budget for an
advertising campaign is a collaborative effort between the advertising
agency and the advertiser’s marketing department.  
  
 In this unit, we will look at two aspects of the advertising campaign
budget: (1) How much will it cost the advertiser to create and place
advertising? and (2) How much will it cost the advertising agency to
create a well-researched advertising campaign proposal?  In addition to
our text’s Fortune 100 advertiser perspective, the readings in the
subunits offer a view of the advertising budget from the small business
practitioner’s point of reference.*
