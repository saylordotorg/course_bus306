**Unit 5: Segmenting, Targeting, and Positioning** <span id="5"></span> 
*Advertisers pay for the reach and the frequency of their advertising
messages – how many people see and/or hear a message and the number of
times that message is seen and/or heard. Sending a single advertising
message to every potential consumer is not only expensive, it is also
inefficient.  
  
 To maximize the effectiveness of a firm’s advertising budget,
advertisers aim to send customized messages to audiences with shared
characteristics. This means that companies must break their market down
into homogeneous groups, select the most desirable groups, and
differentiate their offering from that of their competitors. This is
called target marketing. Target marketing is composed of three steps:
segmenting, targeting, and positioning, or STP marketing. In this unit,
you will learn how businesses use STP marketing to understand the
identity and preferences of their customers.*
