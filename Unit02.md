**Unit 2: Advertising and Society** <span id="2"></span> 
*According to Merriam-Webster: “ethnocentrism is characterized by or
based on the attitude that one’s own group is superior.”  Because of
this, we may view the behaviors of others as wrong. However, as we come
to study cultures other than our own, we learn that those behaviors are
merely different, and that others’ ways are correct, too. And, not
surprisingly, advertising plays a role in how we view ourselves and our
society. In this unit, we will discuss the economic and social
influences of advertising, ethical considerations for industry
practitioners, and regulatory bodies for the industry.  
  
 Some may argue that advertising rarely furnishes useful information
and, instead, perpetuates superficial stereotypes in our society. What
contributions does advertising make to society? Advertising is without a
doubt a vital component of a free market economy. The authors of the
text note that the US advertising industry itself accounts for 2.5
percent of the nation’s Gross National Product. Advertising can serve
both as a stimulus for economic growth as well as an indicator of
economic change.  
  
 Advertising is more than just a competitive tool for business; it
defines our culture. Since early in the 20<sup>th</sup> century,
advertisers have attempted to go beyond communicating simple product
information. Today’s advertisers link their brands to lifestyles. As a
result, the brand’s emotional benefits may be as important as functional
benefits to the advertiser’s target market.*
