Advertising is an integral part of our modern, media-dominated society.
While many of us have a love-hate relationship with the industry,
advertising can be wonderfully entertaining. However, is advertising a
necessary evil? Does it make meaningful contributions to our society?
With the incredible growth of social media, now is a particularly
exciting time to explore the fascinating world of advertising. The
purpose of this course is to lead students in an exploration of
fundamental advertising principles and the role advertising plays in the
promotional mix. You will learn where advertising fits in the Marketing
Mix, also known as the four Ps: Product, Price, Place, and Promotion.
Although some consider all promotion synonymous with advertising, you
will learn the unique characteristics that separate advertising from
other forms of promotional communication. You will revisit some familiar
marketing concepts within a new framework, approaching the subject from
the advertiser’s perspective. Our text uses a case-based approach that
focuses on the activities of a successful advertising agency,
Shepardson, Stern and Kaminsky (SS+K). You will see the practical
applications of advertising theory as we follow SS+K through the
formulation and implementation of a real-world advertising campaign.
This model will allow you to see how businesses blend creativity with
tested advertising principles to develop promotional communication that
builds brand equity. You will learn that while creativity is certainly
an important aspect of advertising, businesses must also follow a
systematic planning approach to get the maximum value from their
advertising spending. You will see advertising in an entirely new light
as you examine the discipline through the lens of today’s advertiser. As
you work your way through the units, you will see that each one builds
upon those before it.  After the overview of advertising – where you
will learn the definition of advertising and how it fits into the
marketing mix – you will move on to advertising’s place in our society.
Next, you will learn about the ways in which advertisers communicate
with us and how and why consumers behave the way they do. Market
research, an essential tool in uncovering information, follows. Here,
you will learn about the kinds of information needed to meet a market’s
needs, and the ways in which that information is obtained. After that,
you will move on to how advertisers choose their target markets. Once a
target market has been determined, advertisers can set an appropriate
budget for their advertising campaigns. This will be covered in Unit 6.
Unit 7 focuses on the next step in the process, which is advertising
strategy – the pathway to setting objectives and reaching advertising
goals. Once goals and objectives are formulated, it is important to have
a coordinated marketing effort – this is covered in Unit 8.  Media
planning, the process of determining where advertising will be placed,
is the natural next step, and is covered in Unit 9. And finally, in Unit
10, once all aspects of a plan are in place, they need to be executed
and then evaluated for effectiveness.
